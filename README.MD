#Property Manager

## Project information

Effective property management for maintaining the longevity and value of real estate assets yet it remains one of the most under digitized sectors in property investment. 
From tracking lightbulb inventories to coordinating roof repairs, today's property trustees often juggle spreadsheets,emails, and manual approvals that leave room for error and inefficiency.

This tool aims to simplify, modernize, and enhance the administration of property maintenance operations. 
This system consolidates contractor sourcing, quote approvals, expense tracking, and inventory management into a single, intuitive interface. It offers practical tools like contractor rating systems, service history logging, and visual proof of work, while also
providing a clear, up to date view of maintenance progress and budgets. Trustees will have access to tools that enable informed decision-making, efficient inventory management, and real time identification of cost saving opportunities
