### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/COS301-SE-2025/Property-Management.git
cd property-management

# Start with Docker Compose (recommended)
docker-compose up -d

# Or run components individually:

# Database setup
./scripts/setup-database.sh

# Backend setup
cd Backend/property-management
./gradlew bootRun

# Frontend setup
cd Frontend/Property-Manager
npm install
ng serve
```

# Configure your AWS credentials and database connections
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:4200`

## 🌳 Git Strategy

We implement a robust GitFlow branching strategy ensuring code quality and collaborative development:

### Branch Structure
- **`main`** - Production-ready, stable releases only
- **`dev`** - Integration branch for ongoing development
- **`frontend/*`** - All code concerning frontend features
- **`backend/*`** - All code concerning backend features


### Workflow Process
1. Create feature branches from `dev`
2. Implement changes with comprehensive tests
3. Submit pull requests with detailed descriptions
4. Code review process (minimum 2 approvals required)
5. Automated CI/CD pipeline validation
6. Merge to `dev` after approval
7. Regular releases from `dev` to `main`
