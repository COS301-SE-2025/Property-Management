About me
=====

Hi, I'm Sean! I'm a third-year Computer Science student with a passion for coding, problem-solving, and exploring the ever-evolving world of technology. I enjoy learning about new programming paradigms and software development trends. Whether it's building building projects, optimizing server performance, or diving into the intricacies of programming languages themselves, I thrive on the challenges that come with software development.

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m always eager to expand my knowledge in areas like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. I love collaborating with like-minded individuals, tackling complex problems, and constantly improving my skill set.
