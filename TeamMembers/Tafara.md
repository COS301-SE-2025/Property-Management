About me
=====

I am an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for solving complex problems through innovative and efficient solutions. I enjoy building systems that are not only functional but also scalable and maintainable. My primary interests lie in Backend Development, where I focus on creating robust APIs, managing databases, and optimizing server-side logic. I also have a growing appreciation for UI/UX design, and I enjoy exploring how thoughtful design can enhance user experience and product usability.

I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge, improve my coding practices, and stay updated with industry trends. My goal is to continuously push the boundaries of my development skills, both technically and creatively, and to become a well-rounded engineer capable of contributing meaningfully to impactful software projects.
