# Property Management System - Software Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the requirements for the Property Management system, a comprehensive solution designed to streamline maintenance operations for property managers and corporate bodies. The system addresses critical challenges in contractor management, inventory control, and maintenance planning to enhance operational efficiency and financial oversight.

### 1.2 Business Need

Property forms the foundation of a healthy economy, with proper maintenance being essential to preserving and growing property investments. Current property management processes involve complex, disconnected activities such as:

- Obtaining multiple quotes
- Tracking contractor performance history
- Managing inventory
- Planning maintenance schedules

These fragmented processes lead to inefficiencies, inconsistent record-keeping, and potential financial losses. The Property Management system aims to consolidate these activities into a single, cohesive platform that provides clear insights into current property conditions and future maintenance requirements.

### 1.3 Project Scope

The Property Management system will deliver a multi-tenant web application focused on three core areas:

#### Contractor Sourcing and Management:
- Track contractor details
- Document completed work with visual evidence
- Implement performance ratings
- Integrate with maintenance plans
- Manage associated expenses

#### Inventory Management:
- Monitor the movement of inventory items
- Implement trustee approval workflows
- Track usage by specific contractors on designated projects

#### Quote Management:
- Facilitate collection, comparison, and approval of contractor quotes for maintenance projects

The system will be built using:
- **Frontend**: Angular with PrimeNG
- **Backend**: Kotlin Spring Boot
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Hosting**: AWS cloud services (within the free tier)
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito

The solution will adhere to security best practices and implement multi-tenancy architecture to ensure appropriate data isolation between different property entities.
